## Costa Rican Household Poverty

### Define the Problem
How can we more accurately classify the poverty levels of Costa Rican households using observeable attributes, ie education level, monthly rent, building materials, or assets, in order to predict their level of need? In order to assess the accuracy of any predictive model built, an F1 score will be used to evaluate its predictiveness.

### Identify Client
The client is the Inter-American Development Bank, who wants to assess income qualification for families in need within Costa Rica.
